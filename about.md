Offensium was founded by two close friends driven by a deep desire to understand how systems work and how to exploit them. Their combined skill set spans vulnerability research, binary exploitation, red teaming, and malware development. We believe that learning and personal growth are a continuous process, and Offensium itself is a direct result of this. We're commited to sharing our knowledge with the world, not keeping it behind closed doors. 

The name offensium is a blend of the word _offense_ and the pseudo-Latin suffix _-ium_ which is a form of classical and scientific nomenclature to signify a place, concept, or domain (e.g. imperium, consortium). The word offense here refers not to aggresion, but to the field of offensive security. Together this forms Offensium

Offensium isn’t a commercial company it’s a personal project born out of curiosity and passion.  However we do take on security research projects occasionally, if they’re technically challenging or interesting enough.

For any inquiries, feel free to reach out to us. May it be a security related question about any of the blogs we've published, red teaming, malware development we're happy to help where we can. If you just want to have a chat, swap ideas, or share thoughts, we’re always open for a conversation.
